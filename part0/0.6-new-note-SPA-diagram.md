    Note right of browser: The browser appends the note that the user saves to our <br>notes data, which causes the page to get re-rendered, and our new note to be <br>displayed without requesting a new page from the data.

    Note right of browser: The code in our sample app does not properly handle errors. <br>In case there is an error in saving the data in the server, the data we are <br>showing on the browser might not match the data on the server.
